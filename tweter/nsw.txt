I was starving.

99% of people wouldn't do it. Everyone was "too busy". I ended up in acute care at RNS Hospital. I almost died.

I can't let it go, I'm still really bitter about it.Yesterday my best friend of 31 years and a fellow SW passed. It’s left a huge hole in my life. She lived 4 doors down from me, so I saw her a few times a day. She still worked up to the age of 80 with her regs of 50 years!
