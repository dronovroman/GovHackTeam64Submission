Is it because I poisoned you with wine last night? (Which btw I very rarely drink!)What an emotionally exhausting day. This bear needs to sleep for atleast 3 months. My poor boy had a sudden massive stroke and he had to be put to sleep... I waited with him until the vet arrived and gave the injection.

Along with random, unprovoked anxiety attacks. A way I tend to deal with them is taking it easy and reducing my workload as much as possible without being unproductive. Hot showers work wonders too.

But seriously, you're talented at it Spud, the anxiety will pass until then just look after yourself xBc ya know, my anxiety predicted that #1 people care about anything I tweet and #2, people would disagree with me. Both equally incorrect.Yo Josh, as someone that has cerebral palsy and coincided anxiety due to the schoolyard bullying that comes with it, fuck you. What an uneducated fuckwit.

Nothing scary about it.Deus-Ex is a pretty cool computer game but the hacking you have to do is annoying.So right now I think Riot just took the top spot of shittiest gaming company from Hi-Rez and whatever EA's doing in my personal rankings. Apparently having Nazis run riot in your company is A-OK for being one of the Tier 1 Esport games in the world.

How fine it must be to not require things like details to form judgements.

What's it like being a cliche? Im assuming very dull.By “welfare whingers” I mean individuals who fail to realise that a small rent increase for a small minority of people is a small sacrifice for investing $400m+ in significantly reducing the cost of living.Hidden because women in the Liberal party decided that politics was more important than the welfare of other womenWhen did I say that?  Mind you it takes a lot of welfare cheats to steal what the rich can get away with.  Two cousins Anthony Castagna and Robert Agius went to jail forfailing to declare of $5.7million of income and bonuses.  That's a lot of welfare cheats.Are you referring to skilled migration quotas who have to have a job to immigrate? Or the humanitarian intake whose welfare and working rights are limited?

Not so much in other countries with more redistributive taxation and more effective welfare, health & education systems.Health, education and welfare are also taking various forms of beating. Gosh, how unexpected.I survived the Royal show. Didn't go on any rides, didn't buy any showbags... Did drink a coffee, did look at animals (mainly the cats), did donate to the Animal Welfare League, did watch 5 minutes of wood chopping (senior round), and did leave shortly after. Hopefully the report written by Dr Marc Cesana is taken into account by CEO & President. If Caro's article is correct, it only made it to Brett Burton. Having worked with Ces at Glenelg, I know he's like you Chris, Player welfare comes firstAn inspiration as to how to achieve absolutely nothing with your life.  The ultimate welfare cheat.except the two kind ones who once did a welfare check on me and took me to hospital. love ya’ll I actually would fuck those policeso you and that idiot Caro keep bringing it up... is that good for the players welfare if it comes out..?? and of course @kanecornesIt is proven Economics that the less income a person has, the more it goes directly into that persons local economy.
