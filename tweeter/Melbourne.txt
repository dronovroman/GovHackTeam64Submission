We have had an interesting year and we decided to have a go at something different!I don’t know of any myself, but your theories sounded reasonable. Most people who abuse drugs and alcohol started young so I suppose that age gives you time to do some real damage to your body, and also gives you time to decide to go clean (and ofc then relapse, which isYes it can start out as a choice to take alcohol/drugs. Recreationally of course. All it takes is one time to feel like you're relieved of all your burdens in life to crave it to the point of no return.

In 1914, the @Richmond_FC grandstand cost 4,000 pounds to build.
That money came in 4,000 x 1 pound debentures (with interest at 5% p.a). 
Richmond supporters built the grandstand.

Hello! Some of you may know that I'd been really struggling with weight, was eating under 900 calories a day + exercising and was continuing to gain. Saw a dietician who put me on a program on August 13th. I was 90.6kg. Today I'm 85.3kg !!just watched ‘The Pie’ episode of Seinfeld and now all I can think about is eating apple pieGet the hate, it is a genetic condition! I literally can't eat it. It is often described as eating detergent. I'd say it is similar. Or like some over powering perfume or something. Bottom line, it sucks not to be able to taste it properly!I’m watching something that truly terrifies me: a man eating chicken wings and nachos with a KNIFE AND FORK!Absolutely gobsmacked that Moneybags is back in the Collingwood lineup after an ACL just 6-odd months ago. Wasn’t impressed what I sore last week, so I hope the selection committee prove me wrong! A great feel good story, just hope we aren’t making concessions on fitness. #GoPiesJust what a guy with glaring fitness issues needs, a bit of time off.Should be in bed here in New York as I have my round 1 match tomorrow but am still awake watching @johnhmillman grind it out like the ledge he is!

SMM comes from engagement - a key differential from traditional marketing.

LAW AND ORDER!!
Here is a snapshot of their executive campaign committee.
#springst #auspol pic.twitter.com/Rp0nCYVuKGI received a text message from one Liberal female MP who said she was too scared to be named but told me about these stand-over tactics and pleaded with me to pursue the story. The text message was chilling. #auspol @ABCNewsMake no mistake.  The "No verdict" coupled with a confidential report that will not be released is proof that @Barnaby_Joyce is guilty. If he was "not guilty" they'd have said so. This is the cover-up, their way out. It shows they care nothing for the victim. #auspol pic.twitter.com/e9c54Y54WhLOL. #GeorginaDowner really is a glutton for punishment. #auspol #sapol #LessForMayohttps://twitter.com/LiberalSAHQ/status/1038233813539741701 …Julie Bishop @JulieBishopMP slays

No it’s not acceptable. It’s embarrassing. #auspolThe Liberal Party has ascended so far up its own rear the only sound it hears are its own muffled whistle.
