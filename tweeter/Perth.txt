A young man who struck a teen to the head with a crowbar, leaving the victim with a permanent disability, has been jailed for seven years. http://bit.ly/2M4PUK6 #UPDATED An apprentice electrician has been granted bail after being charged over the death of a man who was found unconscious in Subiaco with serious head injuries last month. #wanews #Perthnewshttps://www.watoday.com.au/national/western-australia/charges-laid-over-death-of-man-found-unconscious-in-subiaco-20180908-p502jd.html …I am appalled at how some supervisors treat their teenage staff members on a Saturday. I just witnessed a supervisor belittle and embarrass a young staff member at Big W in front of customers. Totally not on — and the store will be getting a call and a letter from me!His name is Hauke Vagt. He's done some killer covers for @EraserheadPress and I may be lucky enough that he might even do the cover of my next Eraserhead release (TBA), a surreal young adult island thriller. I'm real keen to see what he comes up with for that.But the young have "become far less resilient and confident about the future and are more susceptible to the politics of envy." #auspolOur 18s Young Guns win the Top 4 Final!
