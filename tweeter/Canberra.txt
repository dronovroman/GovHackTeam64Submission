I it’s fluff, just want entertainment, unless it’s a drama, and then I want to feel for the characters.I still need to see Solo, but I suspect it's more of the same. Seems rooted in the mundane. Trailers actually remind me of my favourite movie The Fifth Element.Darth Vader as that Pyramid Head "if you see him just shit yourself and run because you're already dead" terrifying absolutely made that movie. To see how people struggle without the convenience of force powers made everything feel grounded and engaging.Rogue 1 was my favourite movie because it was a war movie with non-space-wizards doing their best. The one space wizard in that movie was basically a boogie-man who basically fucked everyone's shit up because he's an indestructible space wizard. That was terrifying, and AWESOME.I recognise the strides forward made in cinematic technique and practical effects, that the original movies still look good today speaks of how ahead of their time they actually were. I wouldn't want to diminish that... but... my complaints remain.I'll stand by what I said about Jedi though. They're sanctimonious pricks who have cheat codes to the universe.
