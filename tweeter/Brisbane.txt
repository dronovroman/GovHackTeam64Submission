Things need to be done perfectly Nothing like realising that you're probably about to illegally lose your job because of a government program which gives businesses money to employ people on welfare. 

Illegally since you're not supposed to displace anyone with this new employee but they'll obviously do that.From leader to welfare dictatorship in 10 yearsI think you're looking into a mirror, most #vegans are absolutely insane, completely nonsensical and delusional. Sad they can't seem to realise they're being exploited by big multinationals and vested interest and not animal welfare.This Obama the War Criminal is responsible for arming Terrorists of ISIL, Al Nusra with the help of Hillary, Saudis, Israel, Turkey, Jordan, UAE, UK which caused death of Millions in Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Honduras to give Social Welfare to AmericansWhy would anyone listen to a turd such as you?  You are dishonest and a liar. You tell us that the illegals are legit, despite travelling over 5 countries to get here.
 They only come for our welfare which they have never contributed to and they lie. Most hate Aus!!Animal welfare organisations await response from PM https://stluciatimes.com/2018/09/07/animal-welfare-organisations-await-response-from-pm/ …Australia has been conned to fund more climate change welfare while China funds all their social and commercial infrastructurewhat a total load of crap the Australian people are far worse off since the incompetent LNP came into officeFFS it's climate change welfare while China funds all their social and commercial infrastructure.No its not welfare you pompous git...WE EARNED IT BY PAYING TAXES GOVTS SPENT STUPIDLY PORKBARRELLINGThen the LNP say we have increased funding for welfare, but the fact is that less people end up getting it or take a hell of a lot longer to get it.Heard program saying institutional child abuse is "tip of the iceberg" Most happens en famille according to welfare stats. Community does not like to discuss this. #turningablindeyeTop 20% of Australian households fund the bottom 60% of households who are net tax and welfare recipients. A plainly unsustainable system no government has the guts to address. #auspol

Especially when the wealthy cost the government more per person than the unemployed.
People don't choose to be disabled or have mental health issuesVirginia explains how they use the welfare card data etc in the video.
It even effected some peoples health insurance.
Very scary Big Brother stuff.
I keep saying that the LNP are using Orwells 1984 & animal farm.The government is using a process to decrease welfare funding, proven algorithyms discriminate against the poor & needy. 
Virginia Banks's book- Automating Inequity.
Through processes & procedures that cause confusion for the poorly educated it leaves them off welfare for longerHey Lyle, do you know what the suicide/attempted suicide rate is for young trans people? 

40% + depending on the country you live in.
