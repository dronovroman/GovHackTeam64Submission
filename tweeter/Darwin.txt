More information and resources available at http://www.rhdaustralia.org.au pic.twitter.com/BLCbdA5ydKTertiary prevention aims to prevent complications once a disease is established. In the case of RHD, this means reducing symptoms to minimise disability and prevent premature death. Examples include heart valve surgery, medication to manage heart failure, and preventing stroke.Secondary Prevention refers to the early detection of disease and measures to prevent recurrent disease and worsening of the condition. This means preventing recurrent ARF which in turn prevents RHD or stops existing RHD worsening.What is RHD? RHD is damage to one or more heart valves that remains after an episode of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is resolved. It is caused by an episode or recurrent episodes of ARF, where the heart has become inflamed.https://www.rhdaustralia.org.au/about-disease Happening now in Australia. 1 in 20 kids have rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in Maningrida, Northern Territory!

Alpha and Omega.
Climate change works through natural causes. If you are an evolutionist (as I am) you will understand that. 
My view is that the constant use of fossil fuels has upset the balance of nature. 
Coal and its like were good in their time. Now we must change. https://twitter.com/ZZiillaa/status/1037543916944351232 …My site: https://misslauraengland.blog  and currently there are 3-4 reflections in scribble form in my messy !
