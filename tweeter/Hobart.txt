What is so deeply demoralising and stigmatising about fatigue clinics is the implication that failure to "establish a stable baseline" is due to patients' personal failure in #selfmanagement >> with a highly volatile pattern of fluctuation despite years of attempted pacing and activity management. So my question to fatigue clinic therapists is: Do they recognise that "barriers to increasing activity" may come from a poorly understood disease mechanism >Right. Does it fail to capture impact of fatigue and limited cognitive stamina on work capability, like WCA?Extreme fatigue (@ Christ College (Webster Block)) https://www.swarmapp.com/c/6xrTY4RA5yw The chronic pain and fatigue are really taking their toll on my mental health@roen_tree Well, bugger.

 before Facebook. Loooong before FB.I swear if you reblog an ask meme from someone on tumblr, it's basic manners to send them one of the things!The problem with this is that it isn't just the tumblr/fandom discourse, it's people I know from non-net life, who talk a lot about how to have *healthy* relationships with people and boundaries etc. It's hard not to take it on when it doesn't feel so isolated.I enjoy using Tumblr as a blogging platform but it could do without the snarky comments some make when they think an article says something obvious - it may be obvious to them, but the ancient world is a vast area of study.

If you have spent fifty odd years contributing to the success and wealth of the country thats the least you should expect.… and 2. bc it's a relatively easy way to show Nathan's unimaginable wealthAlso it's not Russia. It's the Kremlin and specifically it's Vladimir Putin. That gangster has robbed his people, plundered their wealth and kept what could be a very great nation stagnated in a wash of corruption and oil and gas dependence.Well I am still not convinced you have it right - some govt enterprises do generate wealth and return a dividend - its generally not the principle reason for the existence of a govt enterprise but there is no necessity that it not be profitable,Money is magic. It can turn anything into anything else. It doesn't matter how you make your money. What counts is what you turn your money into.

#magic #money #wealth #values #creativity #arts #powerI coached Cricket at a very prestigious Private school for a Term, the Wealth on display at this School was nauseating! It had more brand new top range equipment & facilities that Top class Cricket Clubs! I got handed forms and told anything I wanted just fill this out!  ...Ronni. Please do not accept any advice from this man. No matter what it is it will be corrupted by his primitive belief that wealth is the sign of superiority.

Anyone prepared to commit his life to that belief has no advice that a reasonable person can trust.About his political career it’s all just he Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda!
Not he did this & did it awesome. Nothing more than a brag bit about how rich the Cunce is, & a supposed “sacrifice” of more wealth, umm for Power! Where he failed to achieve well anything except his pay risesSuper envoy seems to think the solution all lies in better trading in water. 

We’ve already got ‘businesses’ hoarding water for the sake of their personal wealth ambitions, just waiting to buy more if they can to help their bottom line.

Also,  bottle feeding her standing on the train would be just as difficult, possibly more so... you'd really need a seat for that too.
