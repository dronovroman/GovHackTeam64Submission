An AI program has been developed by researchers from @UniofAdelaide which they say uses tetris-style imaging analysis to detect breast cancer almost 1.8 times faster than existing detection methods.

Day 5 of chemo hangover combined with bones & muscles that ache & are sore to touch because of wbc booster injection.
I wonder what no cancer me would have been doing today?

8. It’s degrading, it flourishes cancer-like in so-called Christian countries bec. governments refuse to take up their duties under law or execute mandates they’re elected on, its a tax dodge for the patronising affluent greedy, it erodes local economy & ruins environment: charity.Adelaide PHN spoke with the University of South Australia Cancer Research Group and Spoke with Ian Oliver the Director of the Cancer research institute and Prof. of Translational Cancer Research about the benefits of #MyHealthRecord.pic.twitter.com/Jl1y0kfDRb“Writing a sick note can be as disabling as a diagnosis of breast cancer” @DameCarolBlack #RACMAHK18pic.twitter.com/FRmXGIV9rVSimon Biggs @simonbiggs from the Riverina Cancer Care Centre in Wagga Wagga demonstrates some software development that can be used as physics tools at the #CBR Winter Workshop in #MedPhys.

In this article I give a doctor's view on what an AI system appears to learn through the training process, highlighting some of the strengths and weaknesses of modern AI.https://qz.com/1377825/we-trained-an-algorithm-to-detect-cancer-in-just-two-hours/ …Make sure you check out page 17 of @theTiser! @Gabi_illo spoke to @ClarePeddie about his groundbreaking research which uses #MachineLearning to detect breast cancer.  #UniofAdelaide #MedicalImaging @MICCAI2018pic.twitter.com/8U7k7gzjmgNOW: Chris Hartley @childhoodcancr with @AlanHickey5aa in the studio sharing the story of his son's battle with childhood cancer pic.twitter.com/vJsM3uHH9IOn October 5th I'll be taking part in @LeukaemiaAus annual #lightthenight walk.
